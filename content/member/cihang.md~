I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, Santa Cruz. My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, with the goal of building human-level computer vision systems. I am particularly interested in securing model performance under distribution shifts, and developing deep representation learning with minimal supervision.

I received my Ph.D. degree from Johns Hopkins University, advised by Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Alan Yuille. I have worked as a research intern with Kaiming He and Laurens van der Maaten at the Facebook AI Research (FAIR); Quoc Le at the Google Brain. I receive the 2020 Facebook Fellowship.
