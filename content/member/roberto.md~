I am a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. My research focuses on assistive technology for persons with visual impairments. Specifically, I am exploring the use of mobile computer vision, inertial sensors, and location-aware systems for increased spatial awareness and information access without sight.

I hold a "Dottorato di ricerca" in Electrical Engineering from the University of Padova, Italy. Prior to joining UCSC in 2001, I worked at Apple and at NASA JPL.
I serve on the scientific advisory board of Aira and am a board member of the Vista Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired.
