I am an Assistant Professor in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.

My research lies in the areas of natural language processing, structured prediction, and deep learning. My work focuses on enabling computers to understand and generate natural language better (semantic parsing and generation) and to help people who speak different languages communicate (machine translation).
